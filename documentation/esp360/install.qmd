# Introduction

To start, follow the [quick start guide](quickstart.qmd) just for the installation part.

If you know ESPHome, you can skip most of this document and just use the template in the [ESPHome Configuration](https://github.com/ale1800/ESP-360-REMOTE/tree/main/ESPHome%20Configuration) folder.

If you don't know much about ESPHome this document will guide you through the installation process. If you need more information you can head to [Discord](https://discord.gg/PsrK3KDkRy) and if you see something that is not clear enough, do not hesitate to make a pull request and improve the documentation for everybody.

# First step
For this step you will require a USB-C cable that has power + data (a normal cable should but some cheap aliexpress cable only have the power wire and no data wire) and a computer with chrome or edge browser (no firefox)
open the following [link](https://web.esphome.io/) in your browser once the device is connected to your computer using the USB-C cable
you need to click on "connect".


![](/assets/esp360/connect.png){width=4in fig-align="center"}


Select the USB-Serial device, if no USB serial device appear, ensure your USB cable is good and that you have the CH240X driver (the tool give you the link to install the driver if needed)

![](/assets/esp360/usb_serial.png){width=4in fig-align="center"}


Once you are connected you should be able to click there : 

![](/assets/esp360/prepare_first_use.png){width=4in fig-align="center"}


The process takes a few minutes and ask for your wifi credentials toward the end so that the device can connect to your network.
once it's done you should be able to access the webpage hosted by the ESP 360 Remote

![](/assets/esp360/esphomeweb_empty.png){width=6in fig-align="center"}

As you can see it's empty. this is only the generic ESPHome configuration. follow to the next section to compile the firmware with the IR, RF and sensors feature

Now, if you want to change the yaml file and update your ESP 360 Remote directly from the command line, you can jump to the **Command Line** section, otherwise if you would like to manage your board from an intuitive web page, go to the **ESPHome Environment** one. 

# Command Line
First follow this guide that will help you install the compiler for the ESPhome firmware.
[ESPHome tool desktop installation](https://esphome.io/guides/installing_esphome.html).
Now you can use the templates in the **Template** section and follow this guide (under the **First uploading section**) to compile the template provided here for your device :
[ESPHome tool desktop usage](https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_command_line).
You can now jump to the **Template** section

# ESPHome Environment
This option require docker but allow you to manage in an easier way your fleet of esphome device

![](/assets/esp360/esphome_environment.png){width=4in fig-align="center"}

I assume you know the docker basics, here is a docker-compose.yml that you can use to run the ESPhome "fleet manager"
``` yml
version: '3'
services:
  esphome:
    container_name: esphome
    image: ghcr.io/esphome/esphome
    volumes:
      - /path/to/esphome/config:/config
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
    restart: always
    privileged: true
    network_mode: host
    environment:
      - USERNAME=test
      - PASSWORD=ChangeMe
```

Edit the username + password and the path to your configuration (just an empty folder is good, we will create the file from the web interface)

Once it's running you can can access it on http://127.0.0.1:6052/
From there you can create a new device

![](/assets/esp360/new_device.png){width=2in fig-align="center"}

Once done, click on skip for the install and click "edit" instead from the main menu : 

Replace the text with the one found in the [ESPHome Configuration](https://github.com/ale1800/ESP-360-REMOTE/tree/main/ESPHome%20Configuration) folder.
as explained in the template section of this file
once happy with your config you can compile by clicking save then come back to the main menu and click the "..." then install

![](/assets/esp360/dotsmenu.png){width=3in fig-align="center"}

Choose manual download

![](/assets/esp360/manual_download.png){width=3in fig-align="center"}

The file will be compiled to a .bin that you will be able to download. You need to download the legacy format :

![](/assets/esp360/legacy_format.png){width=3in fig-align="center"}

![](/assets/esp360/bin.png){width=3in fig-align="center"}


From there, give it a name and choose ESP32

![](/assets/esp360/esphome_ota.png){width=5in fig-align="center"}

Now return to the webpage of the ESP 360 Remote and under OTA Update browse for the file you previously downloaded and click update
once the device as rebooted, you should see the value from the sensors and your switch

![](/assets/esp360/ota_update.png){width=3in fig-align="center"}

you are done :)

# Template

Here is what the template looks like. you can edit the name field and the wifi ssid + password with your

```yml
esphome:
  name: esp360-default-1
  friendly_name: ESP360-default-1

esp32:
  board: esp32dev
  framework:
    type: arduino

# Enable logging
logger:

api:
  encryption:
    ...
```

You can add your own action.
This is an example that send an IR code that turn ON and OFF a fan.
You will need to adapt the transmit_nec function to your protocol and replace the address and command field accordingly
```yml
  - platform: template
    name: "fan"
    turn_on_action:
      remote_transmitter.transmit_nec:
        transmitter_id: IR_TX
        address: 0xFE01
        command: 0xE21D
    turn_off_action:
      remote_transmitter.transmit_nec:
        transmitter_id: IR_TX
        address: 0xFE01
        command: 0xE21D
```
If you don't know these, you can start by compiling the base template and go to the webpage of the ESP 360 remote, you should see a terminal that display the data from the sensors and the IR + RF transceiver
just point the remote you want to clone toward the ESP 360  remote and look at the code display in the terminal.
It should looks like something like this :

![](/assets/esp360/terminal.png){width=5in fig-align="center"}

The line that we care about is the following
```yml
Received NEC: address=0xFE01, command=0xE21D
```
This line give you the protocol (NEC) the address and the command. if you have another protocol lookup in the ESPhome documentation the specific syntax.

Edit the example template with your value and add as many as you need for every function of your remote you want to clone and use from the ESP 360 Remote.

(dont hesitate to read the ESPhome documentation as it will give you more detailed info and more options to configure your actions)
